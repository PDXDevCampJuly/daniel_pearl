Django Review by Nehemiah:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review 1:

style.css:

Style sheet accomplishes design without calling on too many tags and classes. This simplicity allows for easier readability.

L21 display: inine-block - spelling error. inline-block will not function as intended.

L32 .post:before - interesting use of absolute and skew effects to create a shadow.

fakeForum.html:

Html looks fine.

script.js:

code is well commented and very concise.

L10 $('#submit').on('click', function(e) - Your code works without the event object being passed into the function. Because you declare and set the value of postBody and postTitle, you may not need it.

L48 - I like the way you concatenated the title with the post date to make clean looking text bubbles.

Summary:

Overall the code is very readable and well labeled. My main criticism is the position of the input. To submit content, the user has to scroll down to the bottom of the page, every time it's loaded.

The content input should also be more readable. You use placeholders in html to label each input box which is a nice feature, but an actual label would make the input more clear. The submission button is also not aligned with the post label making it more difficult to know where to submit.

The use of jquery in you script makes your code very easy to read. Overall, nice job.

Review #2:

By changing the input information on one side and the posts on the other, the project has become more user friendly. There is no longer a need to scroll in order to post or view the most recent comment.

CSS:

The css has been cleaned up. The display now contains the type without any nonfunctioning code on the same line.

L18 & L32 .post & .post:before - Good use of position relative and position absolut.

Javascript:

Corrections on script.js have been made. The code is ready to be submitted.

Review #3:

Django

Table of contents

Table is at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ as it's supposed to be.

About

About is at http://127.0.0.1:8000/about/ as it's supposed to be.

Javapic

Javapic is not at http://127.0.0.1:8000/javapic/

Javapic_jquery is at http://127.0.0.1:8000/javapic_jquery/ as it's supposed to be.

Zen Mockup is at http://127.0.0.1:8000/zen_mockup/ as it's supposed to be.



I have not checked functionality on the individaul assignments as you are still changing them.

Review #4:

Everything is working except the jquery join function doesn't successfully pass the name on to the gallery.
As that was an issue that evidently existed in your jquery project all along it isn't an issue of, your Django
project (though it's still a thing you should fix).

As such, your Django project is done, even if your jqueru project is not.
