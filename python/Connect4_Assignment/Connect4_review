Most functions within the view file are well commented and perform the one function needed.

L27 prinT_board - Function is long and contains repeated elements. There are more efficient methods for printing the board. One method to reduce the amount of code would be by printing the board with a nested for loop:

    final_board = "  1   2   3   4   5   6   7\n"
    for row in range(5, -1, -1):
        new_row = ""
        for col in range(7):
            new_row += "| {} ".format(board[col][row])
        new_row += "|\n"
        final_board += new_row
    print(final_board[:-1])
